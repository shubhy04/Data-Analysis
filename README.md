## About the Projects

This repository includes a variety of data analysis projects focusing on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), Excel file, or other related files, which walk you through the analysis process, along with any associated datasets and visual outputs.

## Technologies Used

These projects utilize the following tools and libraries:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Excel**: Spreadsheet software for data organization and basic analysis.
- **Pandas**: A powerful Python data analysis toolkit.
- **NumPy**: A package for scientific computing with Python, especially for working with arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib**: A Python plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating interactive web applications.
- **Plotly**: A graphing library for creating interactive plots.

## Project List

### 1. [Olympic Data Analysis Web App](./Olympic-Data-Analysis)
- **Date**: August 2024
- **Description**: Developed a comprehensive web application to analyze Olympic data, featuring modules like 'Medal Tally,' 'Overall Analysis,' 'Country-wise Analysis,' and 'Athlete-wise Analysis.' The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates the same analysis.
- **Tools Used**: Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook

### 2. [Hotel Booking Data Analysis](./Hotel_Booking_Data_Analysis)
- **Date**: July 2024
- **Description**: Conducted an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data with the primary goal of understanding the reasons behind booking cancellations.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 3. [Road Accident Dashboard](./Road_Accident_Dashboard)
- **Date**: July 2024
- **Description**: Developed an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze road accidents. The dashboard features dynamic charts and filters, allowing users to explore accident data across various dimensions such as location, time, and severity.
- **Tools Used**: Excel

### 4. [Social Buzz - Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization on Forage](./Social_Buzz_Accenture)
- **Date**: June 2024
- **Description**: Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture. Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions. Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.
- **Tools Used**: Excel, PowerPoint, Video Presentation Tools

### 5. [Superstore Analysis Project](./Superstore_Analysis_Project)
- **Date**: June 2024
- **Description**: Conducted analysis on superstore data to identify sales trends, customer segments, and performance metrics.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Datasets

All datasets used in the projects are stored in the `datasets` folder. Each dataset is named according to the project it is associated with. You can find the raw data files that were used for analysis and visualization within the respective project directories.

## Setup Instructions

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubhy04/Data-Analysis.git
    cd Data-Analysis
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Navigate to the desired project directory and open the `.ipynb` file.

## How to Use

Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook, Excel file, or other related files that detail the analysis process. You can run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis, modify the code to experiment with different approaches, or apply the methods to your own datasets.
