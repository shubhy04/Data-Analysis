# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data to understand the reasons behind booking cancellations. Utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, I performed comprehensive data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is located in the `Datasets` folder. It contains information on hotel bookings, including booking dates, cancellations, and various guest details.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubhy04/data-analysis-projects.git
    cd data-analysis-projects/Hotel_Booking_Data_Analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the `Hotel_Booking_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file to view and run the analysis.

## Insights

The analysis provides insights into booking trends, factors leading to cancellations, and patterns that could help improve hotel booking strategies.
